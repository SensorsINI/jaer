**Welcome to the jAER Open Source Project
Real time sensory-motor processing for event-based sensors and systems**

Founded in 2007 to support event sensors and robot demonstrators developed by the [Sensors Group, Inst. of Neuroinformatics, UZH-ETH Zurich](https://sensors.ini.uzh.ch).

## Download

You can find the latest releases at <https://github.com/SensorsINI/jaer/releases>. 

Starting with jAER 2.0, (unsigned) binary installers are now available thanks to the 
multi-platform installer builder [install4j](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/install4j/overview.html). 

Go to [install4j jAER installers on dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ibqmrztay51g7fg5d7mu3/h?rlkey=ulwos9lxmv38rrv5x1flic9z2&dl=0) to download installers. 
**Windows:** Click *More info*, *Run anyway* and *Install anyway* for unsigned app.
**MacOS:** See [opening unsigned dmg on MacOS](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac).
**Linux:** Run *jaer* from the installation directory.

Releases do NOT include git information, but using the new self-update feature introduced in jAER-1.8.1, 
you can initialize the release to a git working copy and pull+build within jAER. 

You will get the best experience running from lastest bug fixes. 

## Quick start sample data

Download [some DVS128 data files from the DVS09 dataset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16b4H78f4vG_QvYDK2Tq0sNBA-y7UFnRbNnsGbD1jJOg/edit?usp=sharing) and
drop them onto the jAER window to play them with the *DVS128* *AEChip* (the default AEChip).
