 * <p>
 * DAViS240a/b have 240x180 pixels and are built in 180nm technology. DAViS240a has a rolling shutter APS readout and
 * DAViS240b has global shutter readout (but rolling shutter also possible with DAViS240b with different CPLD logic).
 * Both do APS CDS in digital domain off-chip, on host side, using difference between reset and signal reads.
 * <p>
 *
 * Describes retina and its event extractor and bias generator. Two constructors ara available, the vanilla constructor
 * is used for event playback and the one with a HardwareInterface parameter is useful for live capture.
 * {@link #setHardwareInterface} is used when the hardware interface is constructed after the retina object. The
 * constructor that takes a hardware interface also constructs the biasgen interface.
